Running and Navigation:

The application is launched by running the ‘main.py’ file. Once launched, navigating the application is self-explanatory. Buttons are clearly labeled according to what they do. The first window will lead the user to choose from three different layouts. The following windows will allow the user to choose a product from one of the two tables. The upper table is a list of all products available for the part. The lower table is a list of recommendations. The user can view the cart and the data charts after the first part window. In each part selection window, the user can also open and edit the CSV files associated with the part currently being viewed.
